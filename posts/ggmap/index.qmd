## How to create maps with `ggmap`

The `ggmap` package makes life easier when you are trying to visualize geographic data.

It connects the `ggplot2` framework with mapping services allowing the user to create *powerful* and *insightful* maps.

<p>

</p>

### What kind of map will I be making?

I will be working with crime data from the *City of Atlanta Police Department*. For this analysis I will use the 2021 crime data and I want to visualize the reported homicides.

### R packages

I will be using the [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/), [`ggmap`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggmap/), [`ggdensity`](https://jamesotto852.github.io/ggdensity/) and [`geomtextpath`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/geomtextpath/) packages. Below you can view the documentation for the respective package.

| **Package**  | **Documentation**                                                                                     |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| *tidyverse*  | [tidyverse.tidyverse.org](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/)                                           |
| *ggmap*      | [www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggmap](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggmap/)               |
| *ggdensity*  | [jamesotto852.github.io/ggdensity](https://jamesotto852.github.io/ggdensity/)                         |
| *ggtextpath* | [www.rdocumentation.org/packages/geomtextpath](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/geomtextpath/) |

<p></p>

If you are missing any of these package then use this code to install them.

``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggmap")
install.packages("ggdensity")
install.packages("geomtextpath")
```

Once you have everything installed load the packages.

> *You have to load the packages each time you use them, but you only have to install them once*

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggmap)
library(ggdensity)
library(geomtextpath)
```

<p></p>

### The data

> -   [Click here](https://www.atlantapd.org/i-want-to/crime-data-downloads) to see all of the available Atlanta crime data
>
> -   [Click here](https://www.atlantapd.org/home/showpublisheddocument/4576/637770569750770000) to download the 2021 Atlanta crime data

Once you have the data you want to use then load it into R.

> *I downloaded the 2021 Atlanta crime data, cleaned the column names, filtered for only homicide reports, and only kept these columns:*\
> - *`offense_id`*\
> - *`lat`*\
> - *`long`*

<p></p>

My data is in my working directory named '*atl-homicides-2021.csv*', I can use the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package (included in tidyverse) and turn the `.csv` file into a data frame within R. I will name this data frame `cobra_df`.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
cobra_df <- read_csv("atl-homicides-2021.csv")
```

<p></p>

Next I will create a simple map that shows the general location of each reported homicide. Each reported homicide location will be marked with a red circle.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
map_1 <- qmplot(long, lat, data = cobra_df,
                source = "osm", maptype = "roadmap",
                color = I("red"))

map_1
```

<p></p>

Now I want to look deeper and create a 2D density plot, using the `geom_hdr()` function from the `ggdensity` package allows me to **perform 2D density estimation**. The `geomtextpath` package creates the labels, and in this case I am creating labels on the map that correspond to the *probabilities* for a reported homicide within the respective *contoured region*.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
map_2 <- qmplot(long, lat, data = cobra_df, geom = "blank", 
       zoom = 14, source = "osm", maptype = "roadmap") +
  geom_hdr(aes(fill = stat(probs)), alpha = .3) +
  geom_labeldensity2d(aes(long, lat, level = stat(probs)), stat = "hdr_lines") +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "A") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

map_2
```

<p></p>

### What did I learn from this?

When I was new to **R** my favorite learning activity was to try and create crime "heatmaps" with Atlanta's crime data. Now over *1 year later* revisiting this was a good change of pace. I was able to learn about these packages and figure out how to actually extract insights from geographic data (*rather than just making cool looking maps*).

<p></p>

### **Bonus!**

> *For some insight on how my mapping skills have changed over time*

Here is a picture of the **first map** I created in **R** on May 5th, 2021.

![](first-r-map.png)

This map took many hours to make, and shows Atlanta's reported homicides from 2009-2020 including some of 2021's preliminary data.
