After I can use this object as an argument for the read_html() function. This function is then assigned to the object page.\n# link to get data from\n    link <- \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld\"\n\n# read webpage at the above link\n    page <- read_html(link)\nFor each of the columns you want to create you will need to repeat the following steps:\n\n\nCreate object with the column’s name\nUse selector gadget to get the html_nodes for this column\nRepeat the below code as shown changing each object’s name to it’s respective column name, and html_nodes\n\n\nThe html_nodes can be found using the browser extension SelectorGadget found here. Using this extension you can highlight what you want to web scrape and copy/paste the html nodes from SelectorGadget.\nFor my 3 columns: title, episodes, and length this is how the code looks:\n# scrape title\n    title <- page %>%\n        html_nodes(\".tracklist td:nth-child(2)\") %>%\n        html_text()\n\n# scrape episodes\n    episodes <- page %>%\n        html_nodes(\".tracklist td:nth-child(3)\") %>%\n        html_text()\n\n# scrape length\n    length <- page %>%\n        html_nodes(\".tracklist-length\") %>%\n        html_text()"

Below you will see how I am creating the data frame with the previously made objects.\nI am also using the gsub() function to clean up the title and episodes columns, here I am removing quotes. Because the function takes quotes in it’s first two arguments gsub(\"...\", \"...\", x) a backslash, “\\” is used to tell the function to ignore the next symbol allowing it through. In this case not supplying the backslash would cause an error as the argument within the quotation marks is a quotation mark causing the function break.\n# create df\n    df <- data.frame(title, episodes, length)\n\n# remove quotes from data\n    df$title <- gsub(\"\\\"\", \"\", df$title)\n    df$episodes <- gsub(\"\\\"\", \"\", df$episodes)\nNow lets see the first 6 rows of our new data frame that we crafted using rvest.\n\n# view top 6 records\n    head(df)\n\n                 title              episodes length\n1       Seinfeld Theme                         0:52\n2       Seinfeld Theme The Highlights of 100   0:40\n3       Seinfeld Theme         The Chronicle   0:33\n4 The Jerry Show Theme     The Pilot, Part 2   0:50\n5    Kramer's Pimpwalk        The Wig Master   0:53\n6    Jerry the Mailman      The Andrea Doria   0:35"
