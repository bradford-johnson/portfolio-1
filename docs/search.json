    "text": "The ggmap package makes life easier when you are trying to visualize geographic data.\nIt connects the ggplot2 framework with mapping services allowing the user to create powerful and insightful maps.\n\n\n\n\nI will be working with crime data from the City of Atlanta Police Department. For this analysis I will use the 2021 crime data and I want to visualize the reported homicides.\n\n\n\nI will be using the tidyverse, ggmap, ggdensity and geomtextpath packages. Below you can view the documentation for the respective package.\n\n\n\nPackage\nDocumentation\n\n\n\n\ntidyverse\ntidyverse.tidyverse.org\n\n\nggmap\nwww.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggmap\n\n\nggdensity\njamesotto852.github.io/ggdensity\n\n\nggtextpath\nwww.rdocumentation.org/packages/geomtextpath\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are missing any of these package then use this code to install them.\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggmap\")\ninstall.packages(\"ggdensity\")\ninstall.packages(\"geomtextpath\")\nOnce you have everything installed load the packages.\n\nYou have to load the packages each time you use them, but you only have to install them once\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggmap)\nlibrary(ggdensity)\nlibrary(geomtextpath)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to see all of the available Atlanta crime data\nClick here to download the 2021 Atlanta crime data\n\n\nOnce you have the data you want to use then load it into R.\n\nI downloaded the 2021 Atlanta crime data, cleaned the column names, filtered for only homicide reports, and only kept these columns:\n- offense_id\n- lat\n- long\n\n\n\nMy data is in my working directory named ‘atl-homicides-2021.csv’, I can use the read_csv() function from the readr package (included in tidyverse) and turn the .csv file into a data frame within R. I will name this data frame cobra_df.\n\ncobra_df <- read_csv(\"atl-homicides-2021.csv\")\n\n\n\nNext I will create a simple map that shows the general location of each reported homicide. Each reported homicide location will be marked with a red circle.\n\nmap_1 <- qmplot(long, lat, data = cobra_df,\n                source = \"osm\", maptype = \"roadmap\",\n                color = I(\"red\"))\n\nmap_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I want to look deeper and create a 2D density plot, using the geom_hdr() function from the ggdensity package allows me to perform 2D density estimation. The geomtextpath package creates the labels, and in this case I am creating labels on the map that correspond to the probabilities for a reported homicide within the respective contoured region.\n\nmap_2 <- qmplot(long, lat, data = cobra_df, geom = \"blank\", \n       zoom = 14, source = \"osm\", maptype = \"roadmap\") +\n  geom_hdr(aes(fill = stat(probs)), alpha = .3) +\n  geom_labeldensity2d(aes(long, lat, level = stat(probs)), stat = \"hdr_lines\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"A\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nmap_2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was new to R my favorite learning activity was to try and create crime “heatmaps” with Atlanta’s crime data. Now over 1 year later revisiting this was a good change of pace. I was able to learn about these packages and figure out how to actually extract insights from geographic data (rather than just making cool looking maps).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some insight on how my mapping skills have changed over time\n\nHere is a picture of the first map I created in R on May 5th, 2021.\n\nThis map took many hours to make, and shows Atlanta’s reported homicides from 2009-2020 including some of 2021’s preliminary data.\n\n\n\n\n\nReach out to me if you have any feedback, questions, or suggestions! I am open to collaborating with others on projects and expanding my network! Until next post!"
